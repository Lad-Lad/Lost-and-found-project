The Campus Lost & Found Board is a digital platform designed for students and staff at the University of Something to report and find lost or found items on campus. Registered users can create posts by selecting whether the item is lost or found, adding a description, uploading an optional image, and specifying the location if known. Once submitted, a confirmation email is sent to the user. Users can view all posts, filter by lost or found, and click on individual entries to see full details. Logged-in users can also comment on posts, and manage (edit or delete) their own submissions. Guests can browse posts but must sign up or log in to contribute. The platform aims to reduce confusion, make item recovery easier, and replace unreliable methods like sticky notes or scattered social media posts.
